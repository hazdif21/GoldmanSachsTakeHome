# GoldmanSachsTakeHome

I have incorporated JUnit in my test class because this will allow me to create individual test cases while also allowing me to use different assert methods.
The different assert methods will allow me to compare my expected results with actual which will declare if my tests pass or fail.
The @Test annotation can be used to declare each test case as independent of one another. This will allow us to run each test individually if needed.
My test class can be executed by running the TestLongestString class. Each individual test will be declared as pass or fail.
